<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Vujjuru Surya Charan Teja, an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at KL University.
 I have a deep passion for anime and mythology, always eager to explore new stories and legends from different cultures.
  I also have a keen interest in mastodons, fascinated by these ancient creatures and their history.
   Always curious and open to learning, I love diving into new topics and expanding my knowledge.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I have a deep love for anime and mythology. Anime has always been a source of inspiration for me, 
  offering not just entertainment but also valuable lessons about life, perseverance, and creativity.
 The rich storytelling, complex characters, and artistic expression in anime fuel my imagination and broaden my perspective. 
 Likewise, my interest in mythology comes from my curiosity about ancient stories, gods, and legendary creatures from different cultures.
  Whether itâ€™s Greek, Norse, Hindu, or Egyptian mythology, I love exploring the symbolic meanings behind these myths and how they have shaped human beliefs and traditions over time.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical and creative interests, I am fascinated by mastodons, the ancient relatives of elephants that once roamed the Earth.
   Their history, evolution, and eventual extinction intrigue me, and I enjoy learning about prehistoric life and how species adapt to changing environments. 
   This curiosity extends to a broader appreciation for paleontology, evolution, and natural history.
    I believe that understanding the past is crucial to shaping the future, whether in technology, science, or even storytelling.
     With my diverse interests in AI, mythology, anime, and the natural world, I strive to maintain a well-rounded perspective and continuously seek knowledge in every area that fascinates me.</p>
